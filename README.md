# Analyzing-Predictors-of-Heart-Disease
The purpose of this project is to examine correlations between the occurrence of heart disease and several predictor variables that may or may not be contributing factors.

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and pre-processing, data visualizations, and used a logistic regression model.

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle: [Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)
