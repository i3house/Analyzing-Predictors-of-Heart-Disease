# Analyzing-Predictors-of-Heart-Disease
The purpose of this project is to examine correlations between the occurrence of heart disease and several predictor variables that may or may not be contributing factors.

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualizations using Python pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries. I also dabbled with data modeling, and applied a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease basis some variables in the dataset.

The dataset, which comes from the annual CDC health survey of 300k adults in the US, is obtained from Kaggle: [Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease)

Research questions that helped towards the overall purpose of the project:
1. What are the correlations between each predictor variable and heart disease ?
2. What is the sleep duration distribution of people with heart disease and those without ?
3. Correlation between age and heart disease for males v/s females ?
4. What are the highest risk factors for heart disease for young adults (18-34 years age group)?
5. Within each race, what is the percentage of people having heart disease v/s those without ?
